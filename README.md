<p>Money is a big part of our financial life as adults and it takes time to figure out how manage it. So here are my tips about what I did to set money aside for college while I was working full time.</p>
<p>First, make a budget, figure out what you spend the money on monthly make your customizable spreadsheet here is an example. This will help you have a clear picture to where your money goes.</p>
<p>Second. make sure you have two savings account one for college and general savings. After determining you spending the remaining balance can be split into these two accounts. So, you know what you need the money for and will not feel guilty when is time to take it out.</p>
<p>Third, minimize your spending if possible do not spend money of fast food that often. Home cook meal are healthier and less expensive. If you can cut off unneeded subscriptions that will help too.</p>
<p>Last but not least live with your parents, if possible, that will help you cut unnecessary spending like rent for example or car gas ;).</p>
<p>The sooner you plan on making your own financial decision to maximize your money the better prepare you will be for going to college while working full time. It can be very stressful but take it easy one step at the time and stick to your plan. And I promise you it will work.</p>
