<p> The new technologies are widely use by people to communicate and can be a way to immerse in a language with teacher supervision despite the opposite arguments that it is an informal way of learning a language.</p>

<p> <strong> Blogging </strong> is one way to enhance writing abilities. And help students gain confidence, is a free networking system, easy to use and collaborate.</p>

<p> <strong> Social networking tools </strong> like Facebook help students discover and interact with people of different cultures.</p>

<p> <strong> Wikis </strong> are a good tool to use and collaborate they are good to teach writing in academic standards. (Hind p. 11) Through reading pears writing you can improve your understanding and writing of the language (Lim p. 2).</p>

<p> You could use <strong>writings prompts</strong> that you can find on Pinterest and use them to begin writing for example.</p>

<p> This method Hind argues elevates students’ confidence in their writing. Also, they collaborate through getting feedbacks on their writing posted on these social networking services. This a way to generate discussion and correct their writing through peer-to-peer collaboration. It helps students develop their critical thinking skills and allows them to interact with native and nonnative speakers of their target language. Through time the participant will improve and enhance their writing and will feel encourage to continue to post their writings (Hind p. 12-13)</p>

<p> One disadvantage of this would be if the students are not familiar with using the keyboard in their target language which will delay their process. (Hind p. 14)</p>

<p> Hind states that social networking “services are considered a great means to interact with other people and know different cultures as well as to acquire a second language and to improve vocabulary, grammar, and spelling.” This is a grate and practical method to acquire the target second language that you can start using to learn the language.</p>

<p> Ways to learn a second language can be websites that teach the target language, or videos (Lim p. 2). For example, there are plenty of websites to learn English like the ones I have listed in past posts that you can check out.</p>

<p> A Malaysian study has found that lack of use technology in the classroom results in a deficient and low enhancement of language acquisition. So, implementing the use of this kind of technology to learn the language will have a positive result in the students learning curve. (Lim p. 3)</p>

<p> In conclusion the use of new technologies such as blogs, websites, videos, social networks Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest are good ways to enhance learning a new language.</p>
